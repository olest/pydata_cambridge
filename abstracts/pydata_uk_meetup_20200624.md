## Abstracts for the 2nd PyData UK meetup - June 24th 2020

** Nikoleta E. Glynatsi - A bibliometric study of a research field **

Data mining techniques can be used to collect articlesâ€™ metadata. I have written a 
library that allows a user to collect data from five different prominent sources; 
Arcas. This talk briefly covers an overview of the data collection, and mainly focuses 
on the insights that can be gained on a scientific field from analysing such 
data. More specifically I will demonstrate how natural language processing can be 
used to identify the topic structure of a subject area, and how data analysis 
techniques can be used to understand the behaviour of authors in game theoretic fields.

** Ryan Callihan - Why does my NLP model (which got 96.72% accuracy during validation) suck in production? **

Nothing is more frustrating than creating a nice, tidy model for some NLP purpose to only have it 
fail or go horribly wrong during production. NLP is a weird branch of data science because dealing 
with natural language is a wibbly wobbly thing. We will be going over a few pitfalls one may 
experience when working with NLP and how they will effect your pipeline downstream.

** Matt Wright - When Product Management meets Machine Learning. **

A practical walk through of a recent NLP project which combines techniques from product management, 
user interface design and machine learning to build a product that predicts EUIPO case decisions 
and explains the results. 

The talk will cover how to set up time boxed experiments to build machine learning models, what 
design principles you can use to explain model output and when not to use machine learning! It also 
contains a live demo and a Q&A session. 

Bio: Matt Wright is a CTO, founder of an NLP Startup (Stitched.io), former Techstars mentor, board 
member of NLP business ProWritingAid and builds product focussed technology teams for startups and scaleups.
