**Ryan Callihan - Why does my NLP model (which got 96.72% accuracy during validation) suck in production?**

Nothing is more frustrating than creating a nice, tidy model for some NLP purpose to only have it 
fail or go horribly wrong during production. NLP is a weird branch of data science because dealing 
with natural language is a wibbly wobbly thing. We will be going over a few pitfalls one may 
experience when working with NLP and how they will effect your pipeline downstream.

**Matt Wright - When Product Management meets Machine Learning.**

A practical walk through of a recent NLP project which combines techniques from product management, 
user interface design and machine learning to build a product that predicts EUIPO case decisions 
and explains the results. 

The talk will cover how to set up time boxed experiments to build machine learning models, what 
design principles you can use to explain model output and when not to use machine learning! It also 
contains a live demo and a Q&A session. 

Bio: Matt Wright is a CTO, founder of an NLP Startup (Stitched.io), former Techstars mentor, board 
member of NLP business ProWritingAid and builds product focussed technology teams for startups and scaleups. 

**Nikoleta E. Glynatsi - A bibliometric study of a research field**

Data mining techniques can be used to collect articles’ metadata. I have
written a library called Arcas that allows a user to collect data from five different
prominent sources. This talk briefly covers an overview of the data collection, and mainly 
focuses on the insights that can be gained on a scientific field from analysing such 
data. More specifically I will demonstrate how natural language processing can be 
used to identify the topic structure of a subject area, and how data analysis 
techniques can be used to understand the behaviour of authors in game theoretic fields.


**Nick Radcliffe - gentest: Automatic Test Generation for Arbitrary (1) Programs with TDDA**

Reasonable people think automated testing is useful. Despite this, most of us succumb to the 
temptation to omit or skimp on testing at least some of the time. Could useful, elegant, 
extensible tests be generated automatically? gentest is embryonic functionality in the 
Python tdda library (available from PyPI [pip] and from Github) that can be used to 
generate tests automatically for arbitrary command-line programs or scripts — Python programs, 
shell scripts, C, Node, Swift, Java — gentest doesn’t care. The tests will be in Python, 
but the code can be anything. This talk will motivate and introduce gentest and show it 
in action.

(1) arbitrary command-line programs; gentest isn’t yet clever enough to test GUIs or Mobile apps.

**Luciano Resende - Introducing Elyra - Extending JupyterLab for AI**

In this session, Luciano will be walking you through a real use case pipeline that uses Elyra 
features to help analyze COVID-19 related datasets. He will introduce Elyra, a project built 
to extend JupyterLab with AI-centric capabilities. He'll showcase the extensions that allow 
you to build Notebook Pipelines and execute these in a Kubeflow environment, execute notebooks 
as batch jobs, the ability to create, edit and execute Python scripts directly from JupyterLab, 

Luciano Resende is an STSM and Open Source Data Science/AI Platform Architect at IBM CODAIT 
(formerly Spark Technology Center). He has been contributing to open source at The ASF for over 10 years, 
he is a member of ASF and is currently contributing to various big data related Apache projects around the 
Apache Spark ecosystem. Currently, Luciano is contributing to Jupyter Ecosystem projects building scalable, 
secure and flexible Enterprise Data Science platforms.
